Everyone, I recommend you commit/push to your own branch before merging your code to master. Here's how you do it:
      git branch <name of your branch>                /* create a new branch*/
      git checkout <name of the branch>               /* switch to a specific branch*/
      git push origin <name of your branch>           /* push to your branch*/
